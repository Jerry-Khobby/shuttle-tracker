For a shuttle tracker app with the features you've described, you'll need a database structure that can handle users (both students and drivers), buses, routes, trips, and locations. Here's a brief overview of the database structure and how to link them:

1. Users Table:
   - user_id (Primary Key)
   - email
   - name
   - user_type (student or driver)
   - google_id (for Google login)

2. Buses Table:
   - bus_id (Primary Key)
   - bus_number
   - capacity

3. Routes Table:
   - route_id (Primary Key)
   - route_name
   - start_point
   - end_point

4. Stops Table:
   - stop_id (Primary Key)
   - route_id (Foreign Key referencing Routes)
   - stop_name
   - latitude
   - longitude

5. Trips Table:
   - trip_id (Primary Key)
   - bus_id (Foreign Key referencing Buses)
   - driver_id (Foreign Key referencing Users)
   - route_id (Foreign Key referencing Routes)
   - start_time
   - end_time
   - status (active, completed, cancelled)

6. LocationUpdates Table:
   - update_id (Primary Key)
   - trip_id (Foreign Key referencing Trips)
   - latitude
   - longitude
   - timestamp

7. Bookings Table:
   - booking_id (Primary Key)
   - user_id (Foreign Key referencing Users)
   - trip_id (Foreign Key referencing Trips)
   - pickup_stop_id (Foreign Key referencing Stops)
   - dropoff_stop_id (Foreign Key referencing Stops)
   - status (booked, cancelled, completed)

Relationships:
- Users can be either students or drivers
- Drivers are associated with Trips
- Buses are associated with Trips
- Routes have multiple Stops
- Trips are associated with a Bus, Driver, and Route
- LocationUpdates are associated with Trips
- Bookings are associated with Users, Trips, and Stops

For the React Native app:
1. Login Screen:
   - Implement Google Sign-In for students
   - Implement email/password login for drivers

2. Driver Flow:
   - After login, fetch available buses from the Buses table
   - Allow driver to select a bus, updating the Trips table
   - Fetch routes from the Routes table for driver to choose
   - Start trip, creating a new entry in the Trips table
   - Periodically update driver's location in the LocationUpdates table

3. Student Flow:
   - After login, fetch available routes from the Routes table
   - Allow student to select pickup and drop-off points from the Stops table
   - Fetch active trips for the selected route from the Trips table
   - Display driver's current location by querying the LocationUpdates table
   - Allow booking, creating a new entry in the Bookings table

To link the React Native app with the database, you'll need to create an API (using a backend framework like Django, Node.js with Express, or Ruby on Rails) that interfaces with your database and provides endpoints for your app to fetch and update data.

Remember to implement real-time updates (using WebSockets or a similar technology) for features like tracking the driver's current location.





To build the backend architecture for this bus tracker app using **Node.js**, you’ll need to focus on the following:

1. **User Authentication and Management (Google OAuth)**
2. **Driver Management**
3. **Real-time Location Tracking for Buses**
4. **Proximity and Route Calculation**
5. **Database Structure**

Here's a detailed breakdown of the backend architecture:

### 1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - **Google OAuth**: Use the **Google OAuth** API for users logging in with Google. This can be managed with packages like `passport-google-oauth20` in combination with `Passport.js`.
   - **Role-based Authorization**: Define roles for **users** and **drivers**. Users only view bus locations, while drivers can update their bus location and status.
   - **Session or Token Management**: Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for token-based authentication to keep the system stateless, which is helpful for scalability.

### 2. **Database Design**
   - Use **MongoDB** or **PostgreSQL** to store the following collections (or tables):
     - **Users**: Basic user details, OAuth ID, saved locations, and preferences.
     - **Drivers**: Information about drivers, vehicle details, and current status (active or inactive).
     - **Buses**: Each bus with fields for driver ID, bus route details, and current location.
     - **Routes**: Predefined routes or areas where the buses operate.
     - **Locations**: Real-time data on each bus’s current location and updates. MongoDB’s **geospatial indexing** will allow you to query nearby buses quickly.
  
### 3. **APIs**
   - **Authentication APIs**:
     - `POST /auth/google`: Redirects user to Google OAuth for authentication.
     - `POST /auth/callback`: Handles Google OAuth callback, generates JWT, and redirects user to the app.
   - **User APIs**:
     - `GET /buses/nearby`: Returns nearby buses based on user’s location.
     - `GET /buses/routes`: Retrieves all buses on a given route.
     - `POST /user/trip`: Starts a trip by specifying starting and destination points, saving the trip history.
   - **Driver APIs**:
     - `POST /driver/login`: Authenticate the driver and start a session.
     - `POST /driver/bus/location`: Allows the driver to update the real-time location of the bus.
     - `PATCH /driver/status`: Updates driver’s availability.
   - **Admin APIs (Optional)**:
     - For managing routes, buses, and driver details.
  
### 4. **Location Tracking and Real-Time Updates**
   - **Socket.io** for Real-Time Location Updates: 
     - Both users and drivers connect via WebSockets to receive real-time location updates for nearby buses.
     - Each driver broadcasts their bus’s location at intervals, and the backend pushes these updates to users.
   - **Geospatial Queries**: Using MongoDB’s geospatial capabilities, filter nearby buses based on user’s location.

### 5. **Proximity and Routing Logic**
   - **Geospatial Calculations**: When the user selects their start and end points, geospatial queries can retrieve buses within a radius.
   - **Routing Algorithm**: To determine the closest buses, the system should:
     - Calculate distances between user location, start point, destination, and each bus.
     - Filter results based on availability and proximity.

### 6. **Real-Time Notifications and Alerts**
   - **Push Notifications** for App Updates: Notify users about bus status updates, route changes, or other relevant information.
   - **In-app Notifications** to alert when the selected bus is close to the user’s location or when it reaches the destination.

### 7. **Data Storage and Caching**
   - **Redis** (for Caching): Cache real-time location data to reduce database load and improve response times for location-based queries.
   - **MongoDB Atlas**: Can support geospatial indexing and provides a reliable way to handle and scale real-time location data.
   - **Logging and Analytics**: Track user behavior and bus usage patterns, which will also aid in optimizing routes and timings.

### 8. **Backend Architecture Diagram**
Here's a high-level architecture:

1. **Client (Mobile App)**
   - Google Login Request
   - User GPS Data
   - Map API integration

2. **Backend (Node.js + Express)**
   - **Authentication Service**: Handles Google OAuth, user roles, and JWT generation.
   - **Bus Tracking Service**:
     - Real-time data capture from drivers via Socket.io.
     - Geospatial queries to find nearby buses for users.
   - **User Service**: Manages user profiles, preferences, and trip data.
   - **Driver Service**: Manages drivers’ login, bus location updates, and availability status.
   - **Notification Service**: Sends push notifications to users about nearby buses or changes in bus status.

3. **Database (MongoDB)**
   - Collections for **Users**, **Drivers**, **Buses**, **Routes**, and **Locations**.
   - Redis for real-time location caching.

4. **WebSocket Server (Socket.io)**
   - For real-time location updates of buses.
   - Broadcasting location updates to clients.

### Example Flow
1. **User** logs in with Google and grants permission to access location data.
2. **Backend** retrieves nearby buses based on user location using geospatial queries.
3. **Driver** updates location through WebSocket, which updates the Redis cache and database.
4. **User** can see real-time updates of buses on the map and receive notifications when buses approach the destination.

This backend setup would help make the app responsive, scalable, and able to handle real-time location data efficiently.
